RTL code for FIX parser
Developed earlier in this semester. It will be incorporated in FIX engine (work in profress) to support FIX session layer.

TODO: Convert to Verilog from current SystemVerilog implementation (should be very trivial) so that ModelSim can handle all the features (just to be in safe side). Functionality is already verified.
